                p I'm a professional bodybuilder. 
                p I recovered my injury through a balance training exercise and even won the competition.
                p With this experience, I developed a balance training organization, FAVE, to promote the balance training movement. 
                p I hope everyone will enjoy working out and become healthier with FAVE.
